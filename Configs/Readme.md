Includes configuration files to be used onsite. Development configuration files should be in-place inside the project folder, so just compiling and running gets you something to work with. 

The files stored in here will be copied over the Release folder by the build.command when building a release.

Update Nov2016 - These file might now be in the Binaries repo of the project - so this folder doesnt make much sense any more.
